# 🚀 Embedded Learning Roadmap

This repository documents my **6-Month Embedded Internship Prep Plan** — a structured journey to master **C, Microcontrollers, Communication Protocols, RTOS, Git, and Embedded Linux**.  
Each month is focused on building strong foundations with hands-on deliverables.

---

## 📅 Roadmap

### Month 1 – C & Embedded C Foundations
- Pointers, arrays, structures, unions, bitwise ops  
- Memory access, `volatile` keyword, register definitions  
- Small programs:  
  - Bit manipulation (set/clear/toggle)  
  - Circular buffer implementation  
  - Interrupt simulation (software-level)  

**📌 Deliverable:** 10–15 small C programs for embedded use cases  

---

### Month 2 – Microcontroller Basics (STM32 / ESP32 / PIC)
- GPIO programming (LED blink, button input)  
- Timers (delay, PWM for LED brightness or motor speed)  
- ADC/DAC (read potentiometer, temperature sensor)  
- Interrupt handling (button press interrupt)  

**📌 Deliverable:** 3–4 mini projects (LED blink, PWM fan controller, ADC-based temp reader)  

---

### Month 3 – Communication Protocols
- UART (send/receive text to PC)  
- I2C (accelerometer/RTC interface)  
- SPI (OLED display or external flash)  

**📌 Deliverable:** Sensor-data logging project → sensor values (I2C/SPI) → sent via UART  

---

### Month 4 – RTOS Basics (FreeRTOS)
- Task creation & scheduling  
- Queues, Semaphores, Mutex  
- Task sync with interrupts  
- Periodic tasks with timers  

**📌 Deliverable:** FreeRTOS demo  
- Task1: LED blink  
- Task2: UART data print  
- Task3: Sensor read + Queue → UART  

---

### Month 5 – Debugging & Git
- IDE debugging: breakpoints, watch variables, stepping through code  
- Daily Git/GitHub usage: commit, branch, merge, push/pull  
- Debugging with serial prints + logic analyzer  

**📌 Deliverable:** Cleaned-up projects pushed to GitHub with proper READMEs  

---

### Month 6 – Embedded Linux Basics (Optional but Valuable)
- Linux shell scripting (bash basics)  
- Cross-compiling for Raspberry Pi  
- Simple kernel module (hello driver)  
- Basic networking (ping, SSH, ifconfig)  

**📌 Deliverable:**  
- Raspberry Pi GPIO LED driver  
- Write-up: *“How I built a kernel module as a 2nd-year student.”*  

---

## 🎯 End of 6 Months – Outcomes
- Solid Embedded C foundations  
- MCU projects (STM32/ESP32 with sensors & communication)  
- FreeRTOS task management experience  
- GitHub portfolio of working projects  
- Bonus: Embedded Linux + Kernel basics  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- **Proteus** or **Wokwi** for simulation  
- **STM32CubeIDE** or **Arduino IDE**  
- Optional: Raspberry Pi  

---

## 📖 How to Study
- YouTube: *“STM32CubeIDE GPIO tutorials”* (LED blink, button interrupt, ADC, PWM)  
- FreeRTOS Docs: [Getting Started](https://www.freertos.org/)  
- Tutorials: *“FreeRTOS STM32CubeIDE”* on YouTube  
- Git Practice: `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`  
- Debugging: Breakpoints, watch variables in STM32CubeIDE  

---

## ⭐ Future Scope
This repo will continuously grow as I add:  
✔ New embedded projects  
✔ FreeRTOS experiments  
✔ Sensor interfacing demos  
✔ Linux driver practice
